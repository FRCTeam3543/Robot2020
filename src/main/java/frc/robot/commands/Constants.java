 * Declare non-config (Config.java), non-calibration (Calibration.java) constants here.
 * 
 * Note: an "enum" declares a fixed set of options.  These are better than, say, a set of 
 * named ints because when used as method parameters or class properties, you constrain
 * to a fixed set of values.  Also you can go to/from strings which makes it nice for
 * the SmartDashboard.
